Plan: Policy,Commoon Goals, Threat Model, Mechanism, Resulting Goal
Policy : the	goal	you	want	to	achieve.	e.g.	only	Alice	should	read	file	F.
Goals: confidentiality,	integrity,	availability.
Threat Model: assumptions	about	what	the	attacker	could	do.
Mechanism: knobs	that	your	system	provides	to	help	uphold	policy

Why Securing is hard? making something work is easy, but testing it all ways to break it is hard.

Case Studies:
1. Weak Policies
Sarah	Palin's	email	account
Mat	Honan's	accounts	at	Amazon,	Apple,	Google,	etc
Twitter's	@N	account	hijacking
Solutions: Think well about the policy implications

2. Bad Threat Models and assumptions
Phishing	attacks
computational	assumptions	change	over	time
SSL	certificate	CAs	are	fully	trusted.
assuming	your	hardware	is	trustworthy
assuming	good	randomness	for	cryptography
Subverting Military OS
Subverting Firewalls
Systems not connected to Web are secure?
Solution: Find the weaknesses, better designs

3. Problems with mechanisms - Bugs
Apple Iphone Bruteforce - NAND Mirroring
Missing Access control checks in Citi Bank id=?
Weak Randomness lead to Bitcoin theaft
Bugs in sandbox
